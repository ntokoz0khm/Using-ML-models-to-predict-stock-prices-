Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the future prices of a selected stock based on its historical price data. The project aims to explore the feasibility and accuracy of using different machine learning techniques, such as linear regression and neural networks, for stock price forecasting.

Objectives

	1.	Collect and preprocess historical stock price data.
	2.	Develop and train machine learning models on the historical data.
	3.	Evaluate the models’ performance and fine-tune them for improved accuracy.
	4.	Use the trained models to forecast future stock prices.

Methodology

1. Data Collection

Historical stock price data will be collected from reliable financial data sources such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. The data will include daily stock prices (open, close, high, low, volume) over a significant period.

2. Data Preprocessing

The collected data will be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for training machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, normalizing or scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. Model Selection

Two types of models will be considered for this project:

	•	Linear Regression: A simple and interpretable model to establish a baseline.
	•	Neural Networks: More complex models capable of capturing intricate patterns in the data.

4. Model Training

Using Python libraries such as scikit-learn for linear regression and TensorFlow or PyTorch for neural networks, the models will be trained on the preprocessed historical data.

5. Model Evaluation and Tuning

The performance of the trained models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE). Hyperparameters will be tuned to enhance model performance.

6. Forecasting

Once trained and validated, the models will be used to predict future stock prices. The predictions will be compared against actual stock prices to assess accuracy.

Tools and Technologies

	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, pandas, numpy
	•	Data Sources: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage

Expected Outcomes

The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can reasonably predict the future prices of a selected stock. While perfect accuracy is not guaranteed due to the volatile nature of stock markets, the model should provide valuable insights and trends.

Conclusion

This project will demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in financial forecasting, highlighting both the potential and limitations of such approaches. The findings could be useful for further research or practical applications in financial markets.
